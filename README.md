## Welcome on my github profile!

### Who am I?

Hello, I am Koen te Dorsthorst. I am a student on the HAN University of Applied Sciences. Right now I'm in my third year abd following a software development study. 

### What do I do?

On my github you will mostly find some small projects I start. I like putting everything I make on here just to have all my projects in one place.
